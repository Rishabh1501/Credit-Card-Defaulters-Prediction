# Credit-Card-Defaulters-Prediction

I have made this Project to classify **Credit Card Defaulters**. \
The project takes in multiple csv files as input and first classifies them into good or bad files (according to schema), then predicts the result.\
This app can be easily deployed on Heroku (deployment details are given below).
